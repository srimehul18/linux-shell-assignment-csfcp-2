Project Overview
This project showcases practical Linux skills including:
Creating and executing shell scripts
Using common Linux commands
Automating system tasks
Backing up directories using timestamps
Monitoring system performance
Automating file downloads
Organizing and documenting the work in a GitHub repository
All scripts are written in Bash and are designed to run on any Linux system (Ubuntu/WSL/VirtualBox).

Scripts Included
1. backup.sh
A script that creates a timestamped backup of a given directory.
The backup is stored in the user’s ~/backups folder.

2. monitoring.sh
A simple automation script that logs CPU and memory usage every 10 seconds into a log file named:
~/system_usage.log
3. download.sh
A script that automatically downloads a file from a given URL using wget and stores it inside ~/downloads.

Instructions for Running the Scripts
1. Make the script executable
Before running any script, give it execution permission:
chmod +x scriptname.sh
Running Each Script
1. Run the Backup Script
./backup.sh <directory_name>

A folder ~/backups will be created automatically (if missing), and the backup will be stored with a timestamp.

2. Run the Monitoring Script
./monitoring.sh
This script runs continuously and logs output into:
~/system_usage.log
View the log:
cat ~/system_usage.log

3. Run the Download Script
./download.sh <file_URL>
